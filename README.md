# LexiTunic

This is a quick and dirty utility program for helping me decode the language in TUNIC! Do not judge me.

Don't use this app if you want to figure out what the glyphs mean yourself! Or alternately, *do* use this app but delete the checked-in glyphs.txt file, and build your own database of glyph meanings by using the Add field!

Again, I know this is not as clean or user-friendly as it could be but I just made it for me :)
